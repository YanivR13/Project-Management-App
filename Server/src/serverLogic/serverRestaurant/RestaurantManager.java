 * To ensure high performance during peak reservation times, the server loads 
 * static restaurant data (name, table inventory, and regular hours) into RAM 
 * during startup. This prevents the system from performing expensive SQL JOIN 
 * operations for every single availability check.</p>
 * * <p>This class follows the <b>Singleton-like</b> pattern, acting as the 
 * "Single Source of Truth" for the restaurant entity throughout the server's lifecycle.</p>
